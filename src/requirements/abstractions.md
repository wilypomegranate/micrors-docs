# Simple and Safe

## Intro

Abstractions in micrors should be both simple and safe.
The general expected audience are those who want to get hardware
working with their board, but not spend a lot of time in the specific
weeds. This means these abstractions aren't meant to tweak every
knob on a board. Instead abstractions should provide a way of making
a variety of boards work the same way with the same code. These
abstractions should also allow for easy implementation of I/O devices
across boards.
